# Case Study: How Casual Riders and Annual Members use Cyclistic Bikes Differently

## ASK

## Business Task Statement

The primary objective is to understand the differences in usage patterns between casual riders and annual members of Cyclistic's bike-share program. By analyzing historical bike trip data, the aim is to identify trends and insights that will inform the design of marketing strategies to convert casual riders into annual members. The focus is on understanding:

1. **Usage Patterns**: How do casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently in terms of trip duration, frequency, and routes?
2. **Motivations**: What motivates casual riders to purchase single-ride or full-day passes instead of annual memberships, and what could incentivize them to switch to annual memberships?
3. **Marketing Channels**: How can digital media and other marketing tactics effectively target casual riders to encourage them to become annual members?

These insights will support the development of compelling data-driven recommendations to the Cyclistic executive team, aiming to maximize the number of annual memberships and enhance the profitability and growth of the company.

## PREPARE

Use Cyclistic’s historical trip data to analyze and identify trends. Download the previous 12
months of Cyclistic trip data here. (Note: The datasets have a different name because Cyclistic
is a fictional company. For the purposes of this case study, the datasets are appropriate and
will enable you to answer the business questions. The data has been made available by
Motivate International Inc. under this license.) This is public data that you can use to explore
how different customer types are using Cyclistic bikes. But note that data-privacy issues
prohibit you from using riders’ personally identifiable information. This means that you won’t be
able to connect pass purchases to credit card numbers to determine if casual riders live in the
Cyclistic service area or if they have purchased multiple single passes.
