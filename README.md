###Business Task Statement

The primary objective is to understand the differences in usage patterns between casual riders and annual members of Cyclistic's bike-share program. By analyzing historical bike trip data, the aim is to identify trends and insights that will inform the design of marketing strategies to convert casual riders into annual members. The focus is on understanding:

1. **Usage Patterns**: How do casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently in terms of trip duration, frequency, and routes?
2. **Motivations**: What motivates casual riders to purchase single-ride or full-day passes instead of annual memberships, and what could incentivize them to switch to annual memberships?
3. **Marketing Channels**: How can digital media and other marketing tactics effectively target casual riders to encourage them to become annual members?

These insights will support the development of compelling data-driven recommendations to the Cyclistic executive team, aiming to maximize the number of annual memberships and enhance the profitability and growth of the company.
